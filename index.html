    <h1>Discord connections test</h1>
    <p>I wrote this page to test Discord Connections' function to have a domain linked in the "Connections" tab on a user's profile.</p>

    <p>Anyways, there's nothing interesting about this page.</p>

    <br>

    <p>This site's GitHub repository has a <a href="https://github.com/OWelton-Rosie/connections-test/blob/main/README.md" target="_blank">file</a> explaining how to have a domain in your Discord connections</p>
