    <h1>Discord connections test</h1>
    <p>I wrote this page to test Discord Connections' function to have a domain linked in the "Connections" tab on a user's profile.</p>

    <img src="the proof.png" class="image">
    <p class="img-caption">As you can see from the amazing screenshot, I sucessfully listed a website in my Discord Connections.</p>

    <p>Anyways, there's nothing interesting about this page.</p>

    <p>Discord's help centre has an <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/8063233404823-Connections-Linked-Roles-Community-Members#" target="_blank">article</a> on how to have a domain linked in the "Connections" tab, so go check that out.</p>
